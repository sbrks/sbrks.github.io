<p>Hey there. I'm Steph. I'm a full stack web developer with deep legal and project management experience. I hail from the east coast (born: outside Boston, school: western MA, post-school: NYC), but currently call San Francisco home. I love making things for the web, writing, traveling, reading, exercise, and ice cream.</p>

From "The Sociological Imagination" by C. Wright Mills: </p><br>

<p style="padding-left:16px">As a social scientist, you have to...capture what you experience and sort it out; only in this way can you hope to use it to guide and test your reflection, and in the process shape yourself as an intellectual craftsman. But how can you do this? One answer is: you must set up a file.</p>

<p style="padding-left:16px">In such a file there is joined personal experience and professional activities, studies under way and studies planned. In this file, you will try to get together what you are doing intellectually and what you are experiencing as a person. Here you will not be afraid to use your experience and relate it directly to various work in progress. By serving as a check on repetitious work, your file also enables you to conserve your energy. It also encourages you to capture ‘fringe-thoughts’: various ideas which may be byproducts of everyday life, snatches of conversation overheard in the street, or, for that matter, dreams. Once noted, these may lead to more systematic thinking, as well as lend intellectual relevance to more directed experience.</p><br>

<p>This blog is my digital file.</p>

<h2 style="">This Site</h2>
<p>Is a recent effort to consolidate everything I've posted in disparate places over the past five years. It covers everything from reporting in Brooklyn (2011) to backpacking in South America (2012) all the way to more recent work on design, data visualization, and web development (2015-present).</p>

<p>This site is built on the Jekyll framework with HTML, Sass, YAML, and Javascript. It is served by Github Pages. The design is based off of the <a href="https://github.com/getmicah/blog" target="_blank">Basic</a> Jekyll theme.</p>
