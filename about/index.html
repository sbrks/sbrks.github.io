<p>Hi. I'm Steph. I'm a full stack web developer with deep legal and project management experience. I hail from the east coast (born: outside Boston, school: western MA, post-school: NYC), but currently call San Francisco home. I love making things for the web, writing, traveling, reading, exercise, and ice cream.</p>

<h2 style="">This Site</h2>
<p>Is a recent effort to consolidate everything I've posted in disparate places over the past five years. It covers everything from reporting in Brooklyn (2011) to backpacking in South America (2012) all the way to more recent work on design, data visualization, and web development (2015-present).</p>

<p>This site is built on the Jekyll framework with HTML, Sass, YAML, and Javascript. It is served by Github Pages. The design is based off of the <a href="https://github.com/getmicah/blog" target="_blank">Basic</a> Jekyll theme.</p>
