Each day passes, in it we feel the quotidian churn of life happening to us. Wake up, get ready, do something, do something else, eat something, go somewhere, come back, go to bed. With such firmly imprinted routines it can be hard to imagine how it is we get anything big--bigger than any one day can give us--done. And yet, big things happen all the time. Big things happened to me this year, even though any one given day never felt all too remarkable. Here are some of the big things, the things that I did that deviate from the standard daily routine.

The 2016 Big Things, Month by Month:

January
- I fell in love

February
- I turned 28
- I recreated a Sol Lewitt mural on my bedroom wall in Brooklyn
- I went to San Francisco

March
- I traveled to Istanbul and Paris

April
- I reunited with some of my best friends at Williams
- I went to Cape Cod
- I gave away or sold ~80% of my posessions
- I moved from Brooklyn to San Francisco

May
- I started a full-time coding bootcamp
- I made lots of cool things for the web (which has continued, regularly, to this day)

June 
- I went to Seattle

July 
- I went to Seattle again

August
- I went to New York
- I started my first job as a web developer

September
- I went to Houston
- I went to New York again, where I attended the Lesbians Who Tech conference

October
- I started a new job

November
- I went to Napa with my family for Thanksgiving
- I built this blog and published a bunch of half-finished stuff I've been working on

December
- I kept working on this blog and publishing half-finished stuff I've been working on


This doesn't account for a lot of other significant, life-altering events that are harder to put into words or that I don't necessary want to post about. Things like: meeting many extraordinary people, falling in and out of love again, the miles of running and biking, the ambitious meals I made, the sketches and paintings and innumerable failed experiments. The stuff that fills our lives and keeps us going, disabusing the notion of any one 'typical day.'
