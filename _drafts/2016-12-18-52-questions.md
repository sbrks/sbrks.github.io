Starting in 2017, each week for 52 consecutive weeks I will ask a question, and use data and programming to attempt to answer it.

A few questions on my mind I'd like to explore

1. In real estate listings, what is the relationship between language (and by extension, sentiment) and factors such as price, location, time of year, and identity of real estate agent.

My hypothesis is that the real estate agent is the most influential factor in language usage, but beyond that, that there is a negative correlation between cost and adjective count. In other words, language serves as a compensatory force for lackluster listings. Think of the use of words like 'charming' and 'rustic' that really mean 'dilapidated' and 'old.'

2. How are our brains changing in response to the increasing amount of information we encounter in the world?

It is well known that our brains have changed/are changing due to the volume of information we are exposed to and forced to process each day. My question is more about the degree, intensity, and nuances of such a change. How much have brains changed? And how long does it take to discern differences via brain scans, etc.? And how are these changes affecting our every day lives?

3. How will the Trump presidency affect basic quality of life measures such as the nation's overall happiness, physical health, employment, and spending patterns?

Acknowledging the enormous limitations I have in knowledge, experience, and tools to answer such a question, I'd still like to think about the process and take a stab at this analysis. Some lenses through which this could be interesting: socioeconomic status, geographical location, and age of a given population.

4. How many flights go over my head on a given day?
Can I trace their flight paths? The airlines? Their waypoints. This would be a cool intersection of geo/map and flight data.

5. An as yet unformed question on immigration patterns in the US once Trump takes office.
I do not feel good about this one.
