In spite of it being Monday morning, I’m feeling super giddy. I’m lucky to work with a really awesome guy who is as into the idea of biking to work as I am. We’re going to work on a space in the office to store the bikes safely, since there isn’t really one at the moment. So that means I can start riding my bike to work! It’s a 7.5 mile ride each way and should take about 45 minutes. It’ll also obviate the need to workout after work! Something I often dread, even though I love, even when I hate.
