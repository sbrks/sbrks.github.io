title: Hackathons and Decision Making

<p>
I attended an all women’s hackathon at Dev Bootcamp this past weekend. I decided to attend the day before the event, and offered to volunteer during the event so I could do it for free. When it started, I decided to pitch an idea. Then I decided to form a team of fellow engineers who were interested in my idea. I decided not to turn anyone away: anyone who was interested in the idea could join my team. I decided to lead this team in such a way that everyone could contribute, no matter their skill level. I decided to collaborate and delegate work based on my teammates’ individual strengths. I decided to build our project in Rails. I decided to teach how Rails works in the middle of the day, and then I decided to scrap that lesson when most of my teammates started down a time-consuming rabbit hole of dependency installation (Git, Homebrew, RVM, Ruby, Rails, and so on) just to get the project running locally. I decided that time could be better spent elsewhere. I decided what features to focus on and get right for our demo, and which features to table until later. I decided to demo our project in front of a panel of judges and crowd of ~120 at 11 o’clock on a Saturday night.

I emphasize all of these decisions because I made a lot of them in a 24-hour span, and they were all driven by time constraints. In fact, I’d argue that I was able to make all of these decisions because of these time constraints. Decision-making has been a big intellectual interest of mine lately. Namely, at a cognitive level, how do we make the “best” decision? How is our ability to make a good decision taxed as we attempt to arrive at that decision? How can we reduce or altogether eliminate decision fatigue, the process in which our decisions become worse and worse as we continue to make more of them?

Decision-making operates differently during a hackathon than a normal day. You can substitute “hackathon” for any deadline-driven event, however. Know how Steve Jobs wore the same thing every day to eliminate the need to decide on an outfit, freeing up his time and mind for other important decisions? I would call that an option constraint: reduce or eliminate the number of options you have to decide from. This is one way to reduce decision fatigue. I would also propose another way: a time constraint. At the hackathon, we had twelve hours from idea pitch to product demo. This was a time constraint, and because of it, I had to make decisions quickly and run with them. There was no use in looking back or wavering; that would detract us from our deadline-driven goal. Time constraints are a boon to the indecisive mind (read: mine).

This must be why time-oriented planning works better for me than objective-oriented planning. For example, when I plan to go for a run, I make my goal time-based (run for 60 minutes), not distance-based (run six miles). I’m free to cover as much distance as I want during that time, and I’d argue that if you are internally competitive in the way that I am, you end up covering more distance than you would with a proportionally distance-based goal. My internal dialogue is “I’ve got sixty minutes, so I’m going to run as far as I can with it,” rather than “I’ve got to run six miles, let’s see how long this takes me.” The difference is subtle but powerful: with a time constraint, I effectively make myself a better runner than I would with a distance constraint.

This is also why I love the Pomodoro technique and why I live and die by my Google calendar. By dividing my tasks into blocks of time, and by knowing that at the end of one block of time I must switch to something else, I am much more motivated to get as much done as I can during that time than if I only switched tasks once they were complete. If I have two hours to integrate a feature into an app, for example, I’ll get it done in those two hours. If on the other hand my goal was simply to integrate messaging into an app and switch tasks once it was done (i.e. an objective-oriented deadline, not a time-oriented deadline), I’d get it done, but who knows how long it would take. It could take half an hour, maybe, but it could also take half a day. This is Parkinson’s Law in practice: the amount of time it takes to complete a task swells to the amount of time you have to do it. Without a time constraint, there’s not enough incentive to get it done as efficiently as possible. I’d spend half the time deciding which CSS framework to use, whether to use a tableless model, etc. into infinity. There’s a lot more room for decisions in this framework, which would of course lead to more decision-making, which would lead to increased decision fatigue, which would ultimately lead to less good work.

In conclusion: for rapid development and team-building, do a hackathon. For better work (or art or socializing or piano or whatever it is you want to be good at), give yourself a deadline and stick to it. </p>
