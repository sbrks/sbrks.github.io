I was able to connect with a family friend here the other day, and he gave me a lot of good ideas for things to do in Medellín. It also feels good to “know” someone here…I have met many people, but knowing someone in the sense that I can call them up anytime and they will keep track of me is a nice feeling to have. I may also contact a friend of mine’s cousin, who of all things is a doctor here, so I could see that being really beneficial as well. What’s especially nice is that I didn’t even know I had these connections in Medellín, it was only after I chose to come here that I found this out. It’s amazing to me that even in a relatively obscure city in a pretty infrequently traveled to part of the world (at least for Americans), I’m only two degrees separated from some people who live here. Cliche, but it demonstrates how connected and small of a world it really is.
