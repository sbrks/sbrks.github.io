Next week, I am leaving New York City and moving to San Francisco. I’ve lived here off and on since graduating in 2010. Before leaving, I wanted to share something I’m not normally open about but that I hope will 1) contextualize and inform, and 2) help — someone, anyone. One in four adults experience mental illness in a given year. This is just one fraction of one story. More stats here: http://www2.nami.org/factsheets/mentalillness_factsheet.pdf.</p>

<p>
A year and a half ago, I came back to New York after dropping out of law school. At the time, I felt supremely lost, way behind people my age, like an enormous failure. I got through 1L and a summer internship at an immigration law clinic, but felt like I had nothing to show for it. The future I spent so long constructing for myself was no longer intact. I no longer knew what I wanted to do, just one thing I didn’t want to do. The previous year until that point, I had been struggling with depression and anxiety in a way I never had before, in a way I hope no one has to (but know many people actually do). It was debilitating. At points, I thought everything was over, that there couldn’t possibly be something on the other side of it. Luckily, it never got so bad that I wasn’t hopeful: hopeful that being in a different place would help me sort things out, hopeful that I could work on myself, that I would meet new people, reconnect with others, and experience a life I felt in control of (to the extent that being in control of a life is even possible). So I left Virginia and came back to New York.</p>

<p>
Luckily, amazingly, it worked out. I did work every day that I was proud of. I met wonderful people. I prioritized my mental and physical health through exercise, meditation, sleep, a healthy diet. Every. Single. Fucking. Day. It took a lot of conscious effort. Exercise, meditate, food, sleep on repeat. It’s been a lot of work. But it worked, and it’s working.
So before I leave, I want to note a few things I learned well here in NYC this past year and a half:</p>

<p>
1. Quitting is underrated. I quit law school because it hurt to be there, and because I knew in the long run I didn’t want to practice law. Consider the sunk cost fallacy. Consider that life is long, and that no matter who you are or what you’re doing now, 10 years from now you’re still going to be 10 years older. Consider that, if you can, you might as well be doing something you feel is meaningful, in whatever way you define it. Consider that “This isn’t a spotless life. There is much ahead, my immaculate peach.” (Thank you, Cheryl Strayed). I didn’t know what was on the other side of law school, but I’m really glad that I took the leap and found out.</p>

<p>
2. It never hurts to ask. Ask for help, ask someone out, ask for a raise, ask for forgiveness. Whatever it may be, you are the only one who can consistently and reliably advocate for yourself; no one else will if you don’t first do it yourself. I’m still working on this; my default still is to try to figure things out myself, do everything on my own, etc. But the best things that have happened to me have unquestionably been the result of asking.</p>

<p>
3. Experiment. I personally have found meditation and exercise as the most effective ways to manage mental health, but there are loads more options out there. Therapy, medication, writing, forcing yourself out of the house for a walk when you so badly don’t want to leave, etc. Everyone responds differently to different things, and I don’t pretend to know the answer, but I hope that if you’re going through a hard time you try something or a new combination of things to see what works for you. Experiment. And of course, and this goes back to #2, it never hurts to ask for help. You can even ask me, if you’d like. I’m still very much a work in progress, but have come a long way since my lowest point, and I’d love to help even one other person get through a hard time.</p>
