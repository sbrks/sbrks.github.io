<p>Three hundred sixty-five days pass. In each of them we feel the quotidian churn of life happening. Wake up, get ready, go somewhere, do something, eat something, do something else, go home, go to bed. With such firmly imprinted routines it can be hard to imagine how we get anything bigger done than any one day can give us. And yet, big things happen all the time. Even to me! And even though any one day never felt all too remarkable. Here are some of the big things--they happen all the time, just often in incremental doses.</p>

<br>
<p>This doesn't account for many other significant, life-altering events that are hard to spell out in words or that I don't necessarily want to post about. Things like: meeting many extraordinary people, falling in and out of love again, the miles and miles of running and biking in beautiful places, the ambitious meals I made, the sketches and paintings and innumerable failed experiments. The stuff that fills our lives, disabuses us of the idea of routine, keeps us both interested and interesting.</p>
