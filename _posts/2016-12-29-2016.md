<p>Three hundred sixty-five days pass. In each of them we feel the quotidian churn of life happening to us. Wake up, get ready, go somewhere, do something, eat something, do something else, come back, go to bed. With such firmly imprinted routines it can be hard to imagine how we get anything bigger done than any one day can give us. And yet, big things happen all the time. Big things happened to me this year, even though any one day never felt all too remarkable. Here are some of the big things. Because big things happen all the time, just often in incremental doses.</p>

<p>This doesn't account for manay other significant, life=altering events that are harder to put into words or that I don't necessarily want to post about. Things like: meeting many extraordinary people, falling in and out of love again, the and miles miles of running and biking, the ambitious meals I made, the sketches and paintings and innumerable failed experiments. The stuff that fills our lives, disabuses us of the idea of routine, keeps us interested and interesting.</p>
