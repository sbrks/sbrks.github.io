<p>Each day passes, in it we feel the quotidian churn of life happening to us. Wake up, get ready, do something, do something else, eat something, go somewhere, come back, go to bed. With such firmly imprinted routines it can be hard to imagine how it is we get anything bigbigger than any one day can give usdone. And yet, big things happen all the time. Big things happened to me this year, even though any one given day never felt all too remarkable. Here are some of the big things, the things that I did that deviate from the standard daily routine.</p>

Things like: meeting many extraordinary people, falling in and out of love again, the miles of running and biking, the ambitious meals I made, the sketches and paintings and innumerable failed experiments. The stuff that fills our lives and keeps us going, disabusing the notion of any one typical day.</p>
